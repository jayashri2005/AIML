"reinforcement learning" -> means learning from rewards and punishments
i.e robots,deepseek
AlexNet (2012):

8 layers: 5 Conv + 3 FC
Revolutionized ImageNet classification
Used ReLU, Dropout, Data augmentation
Architecture: Conv(11) → Pool → Conv(5) → Pool → Conv(3)×3 → FC×2 → Output
VGG16 (2014):

16 layers: 13 Conv + 3 FC
All 3×3 convolutions, uniform structure
Very deep but simple: Conv(3)×2 → Pool → Conv(3)×2 → Pool → Conv(3)×3 → Pool → FC×3
More parameters than AlexNet
Key differences:

AlexNet: Larger kernels (11×11, 5×5), fewer layers
VGG16: Smaller kernels (3×3), much deeper, more uniform

"transfer learning" -> means using a pre-trained model and fine-tuning it for a specific task
"concept"
Take a model trained on large dataset (like AlexNet,VGG16)
Reuse learned features (edges, textures, patterns)
Fine-tune for your specific task with less data

"how wrk"
Take a model trained on large dataset (like ImageNet)
Reuse learned features (edges, textures, patterns)
Fine-tune for your specific task with less data

"Transfer Learning Process:"

Load Pre-trained Model - ResNet, VGG16 trained on ImageNet
Freeze Early Layers - Keep learned features (edges, textures)
Replace Final Layer - Change output classes (e.g., 1000 → 10)
Fine-tune - Train only new layers on your data
Unfreeze & Train - Optionally train entire model with low learning rate
