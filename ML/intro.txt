"decisiontree" -> means prediction of output based on input
"decision tree vs random forest" -> random forest is better than decision tree because it takes multiple decision trees and by 
taking average of all the decision trees it gives better result

"train-test split" -> split the data into train and test set for training and testing the model

"decision tree"-> A non-linear model that splits data into regions using simple rules. 
Unlike linear regression which assumes a straight-line relationship, 
decision trees can capture complex non-linear patterns and interactions without needing feature engineering.
They're better than polynomial regression when you don't know the polynomial degree in advance or when
relationships are piecewise rather than smooth curves.better for cloud based data,use r2 score,mean absolute percentage error
>> try to get best tree based on score by using test-train split 
two types -> grow-split (pre-pruning: limit depth before full growth) vs post-pruning (grow full tree then trim based on validation score)

"linear regression"-> best when data is growing linearly
"polynomial regression"-> best when data is growing non-linearly[like patchs or curves]
"decision tree"-> best when data is growing non-linearly[like patchs or curves] 
    but it can capture complex non-linear patterns and interactions without needing feature engineering.

    uses -> "mean line" -> used to cut at which point it will be best to cut llry like a regression line 

    error cal = summation of (error in left + error in right)
    "e"=(y-y^r)^2
    "1st split" -> min(summation of (error in left + error in right))
    "split"-> staircase like a obj that never end ; it also be like a linear line but it is not gud 
    lots of hit nd try takes place in hyper parameters to get a better structure

-> unlike regression it doesnt have an coeeficient to deal it with seperate alg under 
"sklearn -> model.important_features"

-> it tends to show 100% accuracy(train) but not in test 60% accuracy(test)  "major flaw"
-> to avoid this we use -> pruning -> two types:
    Pre-pruning: Stop growth early (max_depth, min_samples) - prevents overfitting [by setting max split=2,3,4]
    Post-pruning: Grow full tree, then trim branches based on validation score
    it resuce 100 -> 90\80 or something it also affect the test data    


   ccp_alpha val used to trim tree ; ccp_alpha val are under sklearn -> cost_complexity_pruning_path

-> it reduces accuracy; test data follow train data with larger variation ; if test is small it doesnt follow 

-> convert decision tree to random forest -> because it is better than decision tree
-> or use "boosting" -> builds trees sequentially, each correcting errors of previous one. 
Better than random forest for complex patterns but more sensitive to overfitting. 
Examples: AdaBoost, GradientBoosting, XGBoost.

>> cut data randomly by taking any number of rows -> then compare all of them -> nd discard 10% of columns [fixed]-> selection of col randomly
all of these is used to get yp = "random forest"

"basic boosting" -> decide to cut of num of rows depends upon wrng nd right classifier;
"wrng classifier" -> if it x=cat then it also predict x as rat
"right classifier" -> if it x=cat then it also predict x as cat

when wrng classifier is increase right classifier is decrease
in this case some of right classifier get sacrificed to crt wrng = "AdaBoost"


AdaBoost" -> Adaptive Boosting: gives more weight to misclassified samples in each iteration.
 Weak learners focus on hard examples. Final prediction = weighted vote of all trees.
  Reduces both bias and variance.

"AdaBoost" -> oru chef first try cook biryani, if taste wrong, next time focus on mistakes. 
First chef: salt less, second chef: add more salt, third chef: fix spice. 
Each chef learns from previous mistakes. Final dish = combination of all chefs' best parts. 
Like cooking committee - each member fixes previous errors.

Random Forest: many chefs cook separately, average all dishes
AdaBoost: chefs cook one by one, each fixing previous mistakes

Decision Tree: oru teacher asks questions to classify students
"Score > 80?" → YES → "Attendance > 90%?" → YES → Grade A
"Score > 80?" → NO → "Score > 60?" → YES → Grade B
"Score > 80?" → NO → "Score > 60?" → NO → Grade C

Like flowchart - each question splits data into smaller groups
Final answer = leaf node (no more questions) [only answer]
Simple to understand, but can memorize too much (overfitting)
